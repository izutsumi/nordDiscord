# nordDiscord
<p>This is an unofficial conversion of mwittrien's <a href="https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Themes/DiscordRecolor">DiscordRecolor</a> theme for BetterDiscord into the palette of <a href="https://www.nordtheme.com/">NordTheme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/arcticicestudio">arcticicestudio</a>. I have also added my own color alterations that DiscordRecolor doesn't add.</p>

<h3>How-to use</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Install <b>BandagedBD</b> from <a href="https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp">here</a>.</li>
  <li>After that, go to your BDD theme folder which can be found in your Discord Client at <code>User Settings > Bandaged BD > Themes</code></li>
  <li>Click <b>Open Theme Folder</b> and place the <code>nord.theme.css</code> or <code>nord-darker.theme.css</code> file <a href="https://github.com/izutsumi/nordDiscord/releases">downloaded from here</a> in there.</li>
  <li>Go back to Discord, and it will automatically show up in your theme list. All you need to do now is hit the slider switch on the right to turn it on.</li>
  <li>If everything is installed correctly, it will look similar to the image above. :) <ul><li><b>Having trouble installing the theme?</b> There is a more visual guide found <a href="https://0x71.cc/bd/guide/#install-theme-win">here</a> at betterdiscordlibrary.</li></ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>variations</h3>
<li>There are two variations of this theme, nord and nord darker, you can choose between them. Nord is the normal and nord darker is a slightly darker variation</li>

â€» If any color choices bother you, it is possible to modify it by going into nord.theme.css and editing it using your program of choice.

<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
<p>Thank you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nordtheme/">/r/nordtheme</a> for encouraging me to release this. :) I wasn't expecting such a warm welcome to it because of my beginner experience with this sorts of stuff.</p>

<p>Thank you <a href="https://github.com/IDislikeChair">IDislikeChair</a> for fixing some issues the theme had and rewriting it!</p>
